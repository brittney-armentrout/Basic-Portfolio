            <p>Brittney is the name, programming is [now] the game! After graduating Colorado State University with a Bachelor's in Business
            (concentration in Accounting), I've spent the last 10 years developing a career as a number cruncher. Although my love for numbers
            will never change, accounting started to feel like the wrong path for me. After research, some phone calls, and a huge leap - here
            I am learning a whole new field and IT IS EXCITING!
            </p>
        
            <p>My lifestyle in a nutshell: why am I paying rent when I would prefer to be camping? No, I'm kidding - clearly having a roof over your head is 
            necessary. However, you'll usually find me hiking, biking, camping, skiing, snowboarding, golfing, disc golfing, dancing, or just sitting
            out in the sun taking in the scenary. Sitting still is not my forte, nor is living in one place for too long. In this career shift, I seek
            the freedom to travel and live where I please, while still challenging my mind in my everyday work. When a challenge knocks on the door, open 
            thatdoor with open arms and a smile!
